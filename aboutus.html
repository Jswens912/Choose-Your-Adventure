        <p id=Andy><img src='images/Andy Fiedler.jpg' height=200px width=300px>Hey the name's Andy Fiedler. I worked with elementary age kids for the most my adult life. Though incredibly rewarding emotionally, financially it left something to be desired. After trying out Delta V's 101 course I decided coding was something interesting enough to compete with helping kids. It's hard to switch gears and go from being good at something to being a complete noob, but it's been an enjoyable challenge. I look forward to entering this rapidly growing industry.</p>
