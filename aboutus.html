        <p id=JacobSwenson><img src=images/IMG_1930.jpg height=200px width=150px>Hello all, my name is Jacob Swenson and before DeltaV code school I was working as an electrician. After that job I was told about code school and have always wanted to do something with technology. At first I wasn't sure I was going to be able to do this but the more I worked on it the easier it got. I would find myself wanting to work on my code in my off time and was even looking forward to coming to these classes. I've always had that feeling of waking up and just not wanting to go to work and it's very refreshing waking up and looking forward to going to my classes. I'm excited to join this industry and pursue a rewarding career.</p>
