Definition: CYOA: Choose Your Own Adventure
Developer Epic 1: As a developer, I want there to be some kind of "Story API," that will allow us to create new CYOA rapidly by creating objects
that represent the story frames and automatically generate/show the elements required.

User Epic 1: As a user, I want to be able to log in and play CYOA game(s) on a single page, so that I can have a good time.

User Epic: As a user, I want a visual so that I can see whats going on in the story, so that I dont have to rely on my imagination.

User Epic: As a gamer, I like to have multiple options, so that I can choose what path i want to go down.
