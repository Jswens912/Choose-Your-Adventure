Definition: CYOA: Choose Your Own Adventure
Developer Epic 1: As a developer, I want there to be some kind of "Story API," that will allow us to create new CYOA rapidly by creating objects
that represent the story frames and automatically generate/show the elements required.

User Epic 1: As a user, I want to be able to log in and play CYOA game(s) on a single page, so that I can have a good time.

As a user with mobility and vision problems, I need a game that is easily accessible with easy to read fonts and color schemes as well as a way to select options with ease.

As a casual web surfer i'm looking for a simple game that I can play in my free time and come back to whenever I please without losing my progress.

As a user with the need to know how i'm doing I want a way to visually see how far i've made it in this game.

As a creative developer I want the site to be aesthetically pleasing with nice page layout, and creative css options.
