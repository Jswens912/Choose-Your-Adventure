Definition: CYOA: Choose Your Own Adventure
Developer Epic 1: As a developer, I want there to be some kind of "Story API," that will allow us to create new CYOA rapidly by creating objects
that represent the story frames and automatically generate/show the elements required.

User Epic 1: As a user, I want to be able to log in and play CYOA game(s) on a single page, so that I can have a good time.

As a busy online game player, I need a choose your own adventure game that utilizes local storage so I can quit the game and have my progress saved so I can resume later.

As a considerate game developer, I want to add local storage to my game so that at each decision tree, after each choice is submitted by the user, that choice is saved to the user's machine.

As a carefree teen, I am looking for a new and exciting way to waste time on the internet.

As a bored office worker I am looking for a way to live an exciting life vicariously through a fictional character online.
